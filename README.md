# Diabetes-Prediction-Using-Binary-Classification
📌 Project Overview

This repository demonstrates an end-to-end supervised machine learning workflow to solve a real-world binary classification problem. The objective is to predict whether a patient should be tested for diabetes using medical and diagnostic data.

The project highlights core data science skills including data preparation, feature–label separation, model training, and evaluation.

🎯 Problem Statement

Given patient health metrics, build a machine learning model that predicts:

1 → Patient should be tested for diabetes

0 → Patient does not require testing

This is a binary classification task commonly seen in healthcare analytics.
